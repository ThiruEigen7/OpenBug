ID,BugLine,Explanation
16,5,Pin name 'A' is not a valid pin name. It should be a string literal.
16,10,"Pin name 'A' is not a string literal. It should be enclosed in quotes, e.g., ""A""."
16,11,"writeData requires a pin name as the first argument, but 'rt' is likely intended as the vector name. The pin name is missing."
32,3,Calling burst() twice in a row is likely an error. The second burst() call is probably not intended.
32,5,Calling burst() twice in a row is likely an error. The second burst() call is probably not intended.
25,4,rdi.runTimeVal is deprecated. Use rdi.protocol().write() instead.
25,6,"The address 0x4 should be passed as the first argument, and the data to be written (write_data) should be passed as the second argument. The arguments are reversed."
10,2,The function name should be 'readHumidity' instead of 'readHumanSeniority'
10,4,The function name should be 'getHumidity' instead of 'getHumanSeniority' and the id should match the pmux number used in line 2.
26,4,"addWaveform() should be called on rdi.dc().pin(""Pin1"").vForce().waveform(wav1), not chained."
26,5,"addWaveform() should be called on rdi.dc().pin(""Pin1"").vForce().waveform(wav1), not chained."
26,7,Missing '.addWaveform()' before '.repeat(2)'
26,9,addWaveform() is chained after iMeas() which returns a reference to the DC object. addWaveform() should be chained after the waveform() call on line 7.
23,4,"The readMode should be DIGCAP, not EMAP, according to the context."
23,7,"smartVec(""id"") is missing the vector name. It should be smartVec(""vector_name"", ""id"")"
23,9,"smartVec id should be enclosed in quotes: rdi.smartVec(""id1"")"
23,10,"readBit arguments are incorrect. It should be readBit(start_index, number_of_bits)."
23,11,burstUpload().end() is missing to finalize the burst upload operation.
23,25,rdi.burstUpload.smartVec().end() is not a valid API call. burstUpload should be used with start() and send()
23,26,RDI_END() should not be called directly after burstUpload.end(). burstUpload.end() already handles the necessary cleanup.
4,3,The unit 'V' should be 'Volt'
4,4,The unit 'V' should be 'Volt'
31,2,"std::vector does not have a member named 'burst'. It seems like the user intended to call a SmartRDI API function related to burst labels, but is calling it on a vector of strings."
31,5,std::vector does not have a member named 'push_forward'. It should be 'push_back'
31,6,std::vector does not have a push_forward method. It should be push_back.
31,7,rdi.runTimeVal is not used to create an empty burst label. rdi.func().burstRunTime() should be used instead.
31,9,"rdi.port(""A"").func(""idd"") is redundant since rdi.func() is already chained in line 7"
17,8,"The function to get the first fail vector is getFFV, not getFFC."
27,5,"rdi.dc(""im1"") is not defined. It should be rdi.dc()"
24,3,"Missing parenthesis after digCap and pin. Also, interS is incomplete and likely a typo. It should be interSample()."
9,2,The unit 'us' is not a valid unit for the wait function. It should be converted to milliseconds (ms) or seconds (s).
9,3,The cogo().end() method should only be called once to properly terminate the cogo operation.
13,3,Incorrect function name. Should be getVector()
13,4,Incorrect function name. Should be getValue()
13,5,Incorrect function name. Should be getWaveform()
22,3,The readTempThresh method does not take any arguments.
22,7,"The getTempThresh() function requires a PMUX card name as an argument, but ""02"" is not a valid PMUX card name. It should be a valid PMUX card name like ""PMUX1"" or ""PMUX2""."
29,4,"retrievePmuxPinStatus requires a Pin object, not a pin name string."
29,5,"retrievePmuxPinStatus requires a Pin object, not a pin name string."
2,3,The unit 'V' should be 'Volt'
2,4,The unit 'V' should be 'Volt'
3,4,vForceRange(30 V) is likely incorrect for a vForce(31 V) setting. The range should encompass the forced voltage. It's also unusual to set the range before the voltage.
3,5,vForceRange(30 V) is likely incorrect for a vForce(13.5 V) setting. The range should encompass the forced voltage. It's also unusual to set the range before the voltage.
